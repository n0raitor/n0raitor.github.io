# Welcome
Hi, this is N0Raitor. I am a Internet-Security Master Student and I am fascinated by ArchLinux and love creating my personal OS build up from the ground.

I will use this Blog to keep you up to date on my installation guides for ArchLinux and for my GitHub Repo Projects.

Feel Free to check out my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/normannator)

If you got any questions to ask or you just want to talk about tech-stuff, feel free to contact me via E-Mail: contact@normannator.de
